  I am a postdoc at the Marine Science Center of Northeastern University, where
  I use molecular tools to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes
  of marine populations. Currently, my research focuses on using next-generation
  sequencing and genomics to understand how human populations affect
  connectivity and evolution in the ocean. I study a variety of organisms, from
  fish to sea stars.

I originally made my first website a few years ago as a means for professional networking. Though now, I realize that just as many friends and family members come to my website as do professional contacts. With this in mind, I have redesigned my website to give a more complete view of my life, a true blend of profession and passion. Inside, you will find links to my CV, my research and work experience, my contact info, as well as my personal photo collections. This is still a work in progress, so please check back often as I will try to keep this updated.
